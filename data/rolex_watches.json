Can be delivered as soon as tomorrow! \n\n\n\nPlease feel free to contact us with any questions! \n\n\n\nPLEASE READ OUR GUIDELINES BELOW!\n\n\n\nFor safety reasons and to minimize risk of shipping loss, we must ship to Fedex Office or Ship Centers, where you can pick up your watch at your convenience. Please use the nearest Fedex Office or Ship Center as your shipping address on your order; this will prevent further delays for address changes. We will ensure the address is correct prior to confirming your order; do not worry.\n\n\n\nFeel free to message us with any questions! If there is no Fedex Center near you, please use your home address as your shipping address and we will ensure we find an appropriate solution. Residential deliveries are still possible.\n\n\n\nROLEX Watches: All Rolex watches sold by us come with the Original Box, Green Chronometer Tag, booklets, and Warranty Card (if stated that “papers” are included in the listing information). The Warranty Card will be named and dated if applicable. Stickers will have been removed at the time of purchase from the Authorized Rolex Dealer, unless otherwise stated. The watch may be sized from the time of purchase however it has never been worn (if condition stated as “Unworn/New”) and comes with all standard links that come on Rolex Bracelet models. It may also come with the white serial tag, but that is not guaranteed as some Authorized Dealers keep the tag. Because we often stock several of the same model watch, even if the watch is pictured with the white serial tag, it is not guaranteed to come with it. The watch may also be newer than the noted on our listing. If we list as a 2021 Unworn, you may receive a 2022 Unworn. It is possible that the pictured watch in the ad has “stickers” on the watch, but you will receive a watch with stickers removed unless otherwise stated in the listing. You may receive a watch that has been wrapped in plastic by us, to prevent scratches during transit. Bezel protectors, even if pictured, are not always included.\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe prefer to use the Fedex Hold-At-Location service, meaning we ship your watch to the Fedex Office or Ship Center nearest you, where you can pick it up upon arrival. All of our shipments are insured and shipped Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nInternational shipping to select countries is done via Fedex International Priority shipping. Please be aware of all appropriate customs and import taxes you may incur. Failure to accept an international package will result in restocking fees on a case-by-case basis. We will ship to the nearest Fedex Ship Center to you, and you can pickup the package at your convenience.\n\n\n\nIn Person Showings\n\n\n\nFor safety reasons, we do not encourage in person showings or browsing. All of our operations are online and we deliver via Fedex Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nTrades\n\n\n\nWe happily take trades of Rolex, Omega, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe and most major brands towards any of our listed watches. If you wish to trade in your watch, please send photos and relevant information in your initial message, along with your desired trade value. Our offer for your watch is not binding and is subject to change or revocation. We process all of our trades via insured Fedex Priority Overnight shipping; we ship the watch you are receiving after we receive your watch and the appropriate cleared payment, if a balance is due to us. \n\n\n\nPrice Suggestions\n\n\n\nWe may have Price Suggestions enabled on some of our listings; this does not mean we are obligated to negotiate on these listings nor provide price reductions. \n\n\n\nPayment\n\n\n\nPayment is accepted through Chrono24 Trusted Checkout. We cannot hold watches for longer than 24 hours without proof of payment / payment confirmation. Please submit payment for your watch as soon as your order is confirmed to avoid delays and order cancellation.\n\n\n\nAll purchases are subject to the sales tax rate of your shipping address.\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\nWe offer a 100% Money Back Guarantee on all of our watches! Feel free to shop with confidence. You have 14 days to return your item. Watches must be in the exact same condition as they were shipped, not sized or altered in any way. If watches are not returned in the same condition, restocking fees may apply.\n\n\n\n*We are not an authorized dealer for any of the brands that we list (as are all resellers), however all of our watches are guaranteed authentic.*": "This beautiful Rolex is IN STOCK and ready to ship!

It may also come with the white serial tag, but that is not guaranteed as some Authorized Dealers keep the tag. Because we often stock several of the same model watch, even if the watch is pictured with the white serial tag, it is not guaranteed to come with it. The watch may also be newer than the noted on our listing. If we list as a 2021 Unworn, you may receive a 2022 Unworn. It is possible that the pictured watch in the ad has “stickers” on the watch, but you will receive a watch with stickers removed unless otherwise stated in the listing. You may receive a watch that has been wrapped in plastic by us, to prevent scratches during transit. Bezel protectors, even if pictured, are not always included.\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe prefer to use the Fedex Hold-At-Location service, meaning we ship your watch to the Fedex Office or Ship Center nearest you, where you can pick it up upon arrival. All of our shipments are insured and shipped Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nInternational shipping to select countries is done via Fedex International Priority shipping. Please be aware of all appropriate customs and import taxes you may incur. Failure to accept an international package will result in restocking fees on a case-by-case basis. We will ship to the nearest Fedex Ship Center to you, and you can pickup the package at your convenience.\n\n\n\nIn Person Showings\n\n\n\nFor safety reasons, we do not encourage in person showings or browsing. All of our operations are online and we deliver via Fedex Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nTrades\n\n\n\nWe happily take trades of Rolex, Omega, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe and most major brands towards any of our listed watches. If you wish to trade in your watch, please send photos and relevant information in your initial message, along with your desired trade value. Our offer for your watch is not binding and is subject to change or revocation. We process all of our trades via insured Fedex Priority Overnight shipping; we ship the watch you are receiving after we receive your watch and the appropriate cleared payment, if a balance is due to us. \n\n\n\nPrice Suggestions\n\n\n\nWe may have Price Suggestions enabled on some of our listings; this does not mean we are obligated to negotiate on these listings nor provide price reductions. \n\n\n\nPayment\n\n\n\nPayment is accepted through Chrono24 Trusted Checkout. We cannot hold watches for longer than 24 hours without proof of payment / payment confirmation. Please submit payment for your watch as soon as your order is confirmed to avoid delays and order cancellation.\n\n\n\nAll purchases are subject to the sales tax rate of your shipping address.\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\nWe offer a 100% Money Back Guarantee on all of our watches! Feel free to shop with confidence. You have 14 days to return your item. Watches must be in the exact same condition as they were shipped, not sized or altered in any way. If watches are not returned in the same condition, restocking fees may apply.\n\n\n\n*We are not an authorized dealer for any of the brands that we list (as are all resellers), however all of our watches are guaranteed authentic.*",

The watch may be sized from the time of purchase however it has never been worn (if condition stated as “Unworn/New”) and comes with all standard links that come on Rolex Bracelet models. It may also come with the white serial tag, but that is not guaranteed as some Authorized Dealers keep the tag. Because we often stock several of the same model watch, even if the watch is pictured with the white serial tag, it is not guaranteed to come with it. The watch may also be newer than the noted on our listing. If we list as a 2021 Unworn, you may receive a 2022 Unworn. It is possible that the pictured watch in the ad has “stickers” on the watch, but you will receive a watch with stickers removed unless otherwise stated in the listing. You may receive a watch that has been wrapped in plastic by us, to prevent scratches during transit. Bezel protectors, even if pictured, are not always included.\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe prefer to use the Fedex Hold-At-Location service, meaning we ship your watch to the Fedex Office or Ship Center nearest you, where you can pick it up upon arrival.

Can be delivered as soon as tomorrow! \n\n\n\nPlease feel free to contact us with any questions! \n\n\n\nPLEASE READ OUR GUIDELINES BELOW!\n\n\n\nFor safety reasons and to minimize risk of shipping loss, we must ship to Fedex Office or Ship Centers, where you can pick up your watch at your convenience. Please use the nearest Fedex Office or Ship Center as your shipping address on your order; this will prevent further delays for address changes. We will ensure the address is correct prior to confirming your order; do not worry.\n\n\n\nFeel free to message us with any questions! If there is no Fedex Center near you, please use your home address as your shipping address and we will ensure we find an appropriate solution. Residential deliveries are still possible.\n\n\n\nROLEX Watches: All Rolex watches sold by us come with the Original Box, Green Chronometer Tag, booklets, and Warranty Card (if stated that “papers” are included in the listing information). The Warranty Card will be named and dated if applicable. Stickers will have been removed at the time of purchase from the Authorized Rolex Dealer, unless otherwise stated. The watch may be sized from the time of purchase however it has never been worn (if condition stated as “Unworn/New”) and comes with all standard links that come on Rolex Bracelet models. It may also come with the white serial tag, but that is not guaranteed as some Authorized Dealers keep the tag. Because we often stock several of the same model watch, even if the watch is pictured with the white serial tag, it is not guaranteed to come with it. The watch may also be newer than the noted on our listing. If we list as a 2021 Unworn, you may receive a 2022 Unworn. It is possible that the pictured watch in the ad has “stickers” on the watch, but you will receive a watch with stickers removed unless otherwise stated in the listing. You may receive a watch that has been wrapped in plastic by us, to prevent scratches during transit. Bezel protectors, even if pictured, are not always included.\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe prefer to use the Fedex Hold-At-Location service, meaning we ship your watch to the Fedex Office or Ship Center nearest you, where you can pick it up upon arrival. All of our shipments are insured and shipped Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nInternational shipping to select countries is done via Fedex International Priority shipping. Please be aware of all appropriate customs and import taxes you may incur. Failure to accept an international package will result in restocking fees on a case-by-case basis. We will ship to the nearest Fedex Ship Center to you, and you can pickup the package at your convenience.\n\n\n\nIn Person Showings\n\n\n\nFor safety reasons, we do not encourage in person showings or browsing. All of our operations are online and we deliver via Fedex Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nTrades\n\n\n\nWe happily take trades of Rolex, Omega, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe and most major brands towards any of our listed watches.

If watches are not returned in the same condition, restocking fees may apply.\n\n\n\n*We are not an authorized dealer for any of the brands that we list (as are all resellers), however all of our watches are guaranteed authentic.*": "This beautiful Rolex is IN STOCK and ready to ship! Can be delivered as soon as tomorrow! \n\n\n\nPlease feel free to contact us with any questions! \n\n\n\nPLEASE READ OUR GUIDELINES BELOW!\n\n\n\nFor safety reasons and to minimize risk of shipping loss, we must ship to Fedex Office or Ship Centers, where you can pick up your watch at your convenience. Please use the nearest Fedex Office or Ship Center as your shipping address on your order; this will prevent further delays for address changes. We will ensure the address is correct prior to confirming your order; do not worry.\n\n\n\nFeel free to message us with any questions! If there is no Fedex Center near you, please use your home address as your shipping address and we will ensure we find an appropriate solution. Residential deliveries are still possible.\n\n\n\nROLEX Watches: All Rolex watches sold by us come with the Original Box, Green Chronometer Tag, booklets, and Warranty Card (if stated that “papers” are included in the listing information). The Warranty Card will be named and dated if applicable. Stickers will have been removed at the time of purchase from the Authorized Rolex Dealer, unless otherwise stated. The watch may be sized from the time of purchase however it has never been worn (if condition stated as “Unworn/New”) and comes with all standard links that come on Rolex Bracelet models. It may also come with the white serial tag, but that is not guaranteed as some Authorized Dealers keep the tag. Because we often stock several of the same model watch, even if the watch is pictured with the white serial tag, it is not guaranteed to come with it. The watch may also be newer than the noted on our listing. If we list as a 2021 Unworn, you may receive a 2022 Unworn. It is possible that the pictured watch in the ad has “stickers” on the watch, but you will receive a watch with stickers removed unless otherwise stated in the listing. You may receive a watch that has been wrapped in plastic by us, to prevent scratches during transit. Bezel protectors, even if pictured, are not always included.\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe prefer to use the Fedex Hold-At-Location service, meaning we ship your watch to the Fedex Office or Ship Center nearest you, where you can pick it up upon arrival. All of our shipments are insured and shipped Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nInternational shipping to select countries is done via Fedex International Priority shipping. Please be aware of all appropriate customs and import taxes you may incur. Failure to accept an international package will result in restocking fees on a case-by-case basis. We will ship to the nearest Fedex Ship Center to you, and you can pickup the package at your convenience.\n\n\n\nIn Person Showings\n\n\n\nFor safety reasons, we do not encourage in person showings or browsing. All of our operations are online and we deliver via Fedex Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nTrades\n\n\n\nWe happily take trades of Rolex, Omega, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe and most major brands towards any of our listed watches. If you wish to trade in your watch, please send photos and relevant information in your initial message, along with your desired trade value. Our offer for your watch is not binding and is subject to change or revocation. We process all of our trades via insured Fedex Priority Overnight shipping; we ship the watch you are receiving after we receive your watch and the appropriate cleared payment, if a balance is due to us. \n\n\n\nPrice Suggestions\n\n\n\nWe may have Price Suggestions enabled on some of our listings; this does not mean we are obligated to negotiate on these listings nor provide price reductions. \n\n\n\nPayment\n\n\n\nPayment is accepted through Chrono24 Trusted Checkout. We cannot hold watches for longer than 24 hours without proof of payment / payment confirmation. Please submit payment for your watch as soon as your order is confirmed to avoid delays and order cancellation.\n\n\n\nAll purchases are subject to the sales tax rate of your shipping address.\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\nWe offer a 100% Money Back Guarantee on all of our watches!

      "This is a pre-owned watch in overall very good condition. The watch comes with its original box but *does not* come with its original box or papers. Because the watch does not contain its original warranty card, it is not possible for us to provide the exact year of production.\n\n\n\nThere are some barely visible marks on the bezel, bracelet, case, case back, and clasp from wear. None of the marks are deep in nature. The watch may have been previously polished. The crystal is free from any major imperfections warranting replacement.\n\n\n\nThe bracelet will fit a roughly 7.25 to 7.5\" wrist size. Unfortunately, we do not have any additional links to include with the purchase if additional links are needed.

Please use the nearest Fedex Office or Ship Center as your shipping address on your order; this will prevent further delays for address changes. We will ensure the address is correct prior to confirming your order; do not worry.\n\n\n\nFeel free to message us with any questions!

Residential deliveries are still possible.\n\n\n\nROLEX Watches: All Rolex watches sold by us come with the Original Box, Green Chronometer Tag, booklets, and Warranty Card (if stated that “papers” are included in the listing information). The Warranty Card will be named and dated if applicable. Stickers will have been removed at the time of purchase from the Authorized Rolex Dealer, unless otherwise stated. The watch may be sized from the time of purchase however it has never been worn (if condition stated as “Unworn/New”) and comes with all standard links that come on Rolex Bracelet models. It may also come with the white serial tag, but that is not guaranteed as some Authorized Dealers keep the tag. Because we often stock several of the same model watch, even if the watch is pictured with the white serial tag, it is not guaranteed to come with it. The watch may also be newer than the noted on our listing. If we list as a 2021 Unworn, you may receive a 2022 Unworn. It is possible that the pictured watch in the ad has “stickers” on the watch, but you will receive a watch with stickers removed unless otherwise stated in the listing. You may receive a watch that has been wrapped in plastic by us, to prevent scratches during transit. Bezel protectors, even if pictured, are not always included.\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe prefer to use the Fedex Hold-At-Location service, meaning we ship your watch to the Fedex Office or Ship Center nearest you, where you can pick it up upon arrival. All of our shipments are insured and shipped Priority Overnight.\n\n\n\nInternational shipping to select countries is done via Fedex International Priority shipping.
