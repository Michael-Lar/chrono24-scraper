      "2021 / Complete Set / Very Limited \n\n\n\nThe A. Lange & Söhne 410.038E Datograph Perpetual is a pinnacle of haute horology, combining two of the most challenging complications—a flyback chronograph and a perpetual calendar—in a single timepiece.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Datograph\" is unique to A. Lange & Söhne and refers to a highly sophisticated chronograph mechanism. The Lange Datograph uses a column-wheel chronograph with a flyback function. A signature of Lange watches, the \"date\" in Datograph refers to the large date aperture typically positioned at 12 o'clock. This is achieved using two separate discs for the tens and units digits.\n\n\n\nThe subdials of the watch include a signature large double-digit date at 12 o’clock, day and running seconds at 9 o’clock, month and leap year at 3 o’clock, and a moon-phase display at 6 o’clock, accurate for 122 years, with a 24-hour day-night indicator. \n\n\n\nThis watch features a stunning 41mm white gold case and a white/silvery toned dial with rhodium-plated gold markers and hands. Paired with a blue hand-stitched alligator leather strap. The sapphire caseback reveals a masterpiece, the A. Lange & Söhne caliber L952.1 - 36 hour power reserve, 45 jewels, 18,000 vibrations per hour, flyback chronograph, perpetual calendar, and the beautiful hand finished balance cock and movement layering.   \n\n\n\nCONDITION: Excellent pre-owned condition. Worn seldom. Very few, if any, signs of wear. No dings or dents.\n\n\n\nINCLUDED: Watch, outer box, inner box, pusher, History Of Your Watch booklet, datograph perpetual manual, A Lange watch cloth, and booklets holder.\n\n\n\nSHIPPING: I will always ship Priority Overnight, via FedEx, to your nearest FedEx location with full insurance, at no extra cost to you! I can also meet in person in the Orange County area. More than happy to hop on a FaceTime call to show you the watch and answer any questions.\n\n\n\nREFERENCES AND REVIEWS: Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns, I am always available! I have tons of positive reviews online. More than happy to show any references you need.\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Interested in this watch with a different strap or looking for a similar variation of this watch? Reach out to us! We have a wide selection of straps and bracelets, and we receive new inventory daily!\n\n\n\nPlease ask for any additional pictures or videos you may need! You deserve to be 100% confident in your decision and see exactly what you will be receiving.

      "Description\n\n\n\nFor your consideration is this A. Lange & Sohne Datograph Perpetual Tourbillon in solid 950 platinum. We generally try to restrain ourselves when it comes to superlatives, however a watch of this complexity can be described as nothing short of a glorious masterpiece. It's a triumph not only for the brand, but for all of watchmaking.\n\n\n\nThis model was released in 2016 as a limited edition run of 100 individually numbered pieces.\n\n\n\nPacked into the watch are 8 different complications which include tourbillon, chronograph with minute sub-counter, day/night indicator, power-reserve indicator, moon-phase display and perpetual calendar with large date aperture, month indicator, day indicator and leap year indicator.\n\n\n\nThe dial is crafted from solid silver and has a black matte sand-blast appearance the hands are fashioned from white gold and chromium plated to enhance their lustre. Despite its complicated nature, Lange has done an incredible job maintaining the watch's legibility, with all features being easy to read at a glance.\n\n\n\nThe watch is fitted on an ALS black alligator leather strap with solid platinum folding clasp.\n\n\n\nThrough the sapphire display back we see the mind-blowing ALS calibre L952.2 made from 729 parts. Somehow, Lange still managed to find a sizeable space to put the tourbillon on full display. The German silver movement is finished using various techniques, displaying \"waves of Geneva\" on the upper bridges, perlage on the lower plates, hand-finished anglage on the bridge chamfers , straight-grained levers and actuators, circular grained gears and last but not least, the balance cock is hand-engraved with its own individualistic pattern. To top it off, each of the upper jewels are housed in their own individual solid gold chatons and the bridge screws are all heat blued.\n\n\n\nAccessories\n\n\n\nThe watch comes as a complete set with box and papers.\n\n\n\nCondition\n\n\n\nThe watch is in overall very good condition. It shows obvious signs of wear on the case and clasp, however it is only very light surface wear. If desired by the buyer, we could do a very light polish on the watch which would remove almost all of the wear. The original black Lange strap on the watch is in brand-new, unworn condition (the watch was previously fitted on a different strap).\n\n\n\nShipping\n\n\n\nWe offer free, fully-insured shipping in Australia and worldwide. We ship domestically via overnight courier and internationally via FedEx Priority. Exemptions may apply.": "Description\n\n\n\nFor your consideration is this A.

      "This early 1950s GUB wristwatch is powered by the historically significant Caliber 28, developed by A.

The movement, numbered 134560, belongs to one of the first wristwatch series in East Germany to receive the prestigious Q quality mark, introduced in 1950 to certify high-precision manufacturing.

      "A. Lange & Söhne was founded in 1845 by Ferdinand Adolph Lange in the small Saxon town of Glashütte, Germany. With a vision to transform the economically struggling region, Lange established a watchmaking industry that emphasized precision, innovation, and craftsmanship. He introduced advanced tools and measurement systems that helped shape modern horology. His designs, including the distinctive three-quarter plate and precise movement layout, set a new standard in watchmaking and laid the foundation for a lasting legacy. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, A. Lange & Söhne became renowned for its high-quality pocket watches and marine chronometers. The brand’s reputation for accuracy and elegance attracted European nobility and established it as a leader in fine watchmaking. However, the company’s trajectory was abruptly disrupted during World War II, when its factory was destroyed in an air raid in 1945. Shortly afterward, in 1948, the company was nationalized under the Soviet-controlled East German regime, and the A. Lange & Söhne name vanished from the watchmaking world for several decades. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, Walter Lange—the great-grandson of the founder—revived the brand in 1990. With the support of industry visionary Günter Blümlein, A. Lange & Söhne made a triumphant return in 1994, unveiling a new collection that included the now-iconic Lange 1. This model, with its off-center dial and oversized date display, became a modern symbol of the brand’s resurgence and commitment to innovation, tradition, and craftsmanship. Today, A. Lange & Söhne is revered as one of the world’s premier watchmakers, producing exquisitely crafted mechanical timepieces entirely in-house in Glashütte. Under the ownership of the Richemont Group since 2000, the brand continues to push the boundaries of horological artistry with complex complications, hand-finished movements, and a design language that blends German engineering with timeless elegance.

Meticulously crafted, this watch showcases the mastery of A. Lange & Söhne, renowned for their dedication to perfection. The watch features a 38.5mm platinum case, exuding a sense of understated elegance and sophistication. The fixed platinum bezel adds a touch of refinement, complementing the overall aesthetic. The silvery dial serves as a canvas for the white gold hour hands and applied white gold Roman numerals, creating a harmonious blend of form and function.

The calibre L951.5 movement enhances the mechanism of the precisely jumping minute counter with a comfortable flyback function. This makes it possible to instantaneously reset the chronograph hands to zero during an ongoing measurement simply by actuating a pusher, and to immediately start a new measurement by releasing it.\n\n\n\nMovement L951.5\n\nThe dial layout is well-organised and functional as in A. Lange & Söhne’s historic pocket chronographs. Slightly shifted below the horizontal centreline, the two subsidiary dials emphasise the classic origins of the watch, as does the characteristic railway-track minute scale. The additional graduation on the minute scale allows readings of stopped times to an accuracy of one-fifth of a second. Pulse rates can be determined with the pulsometer scale on the outer ring of the dial.": "Very Good Condition.\n\nOriginal box and papers included.\n\n\n\n1815 CHRONOGRAPH\n\n\n\nRefined timekeeping\n\nThe 1815 CHRONOGRAPH unites traditional elements with latest-generation technology.
